# README

## New Aloha Mountain Cyclery Website
This site is built on Ruby on Rails vs Wordpress to allow for more customized work 
on the backend, and essentially buidling a backend CMS for the shop to do all they need to.
ie change prices, update demo/rental bikes/ change employee info etc.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
  - `ruby 2.5.0` - rails: `Rails 5.2.4.3`
* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation
  - PostgreSQL - `rake db:create`

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
    Test suite is setup with RSpec
    Simply run `rspec` to run entire suite
    or to run test individually... `rspec spec/features/user_edits_a_bike_spec.rb`
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
